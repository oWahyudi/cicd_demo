# CI/CD Pipeline with SonarCloud and Snyk

This repository demonstrates the experimental setup of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using SonarCloud for code quality analysis and Snyk for security vulnerability scanning.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline in this project includes the following steps:

1. **Build**: Compile and build the project.
2. **Code Quality Analysis**: Analyze the code using SonarCloud for detecting code quality issues.
3. **Security Scanning**: Scan for security vulnerabilities using Snyk.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the application or perform any other deployment-related tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the pipeline, make sure you have the following:

- A GitHub repository with your code.
- Accounts on [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) with projects set up.

## Setting Up the CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Create a CI/CD Configuration File** 

2. **Configure SonarCloud Token**: Generate a SonarCloud token and add it as a secret in your GitHub repository. Replace `SONAR_TOKEN` in the CI/CD configuration with your actual SonarCloud token.

3. **Configure Snyk Token**: Generate a Snyk token and add it as a secret in your GitHub repository. Replace `SNYK_TOKEN` in the CI/CD configuration with your actual Snyk token.

4. **Commit and Push**: Commit the changes to your repository and push them to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Monitor Results**: Visit your CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions) to monitor the progress and results of the pipeline.

## Additional Notes

- Customize the CI/CD configuration file based on your project's requirements.
- Explore additional features and options provided by SonarCloud and Snyk for more advanced analysis.
- Explore auto deployment AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- ```yaml
      - name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        uses: einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy@v15
        with:
          aws_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws_secret_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          application_name: "your-application-name"
          environment_name: "your-environment-name"
          region: "your-aws-region"
          version_label: ${{ github.sha }}
          source_bundle: "target/your-application-name.jar"
  ```yaml
